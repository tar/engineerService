Davisor End-User Licence Agreement (EULA)

Date: 1/1/2008

This Davisor End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement
between the licensee ("LICENSEE", either an individual or a single
entity) and Davisor for the materials accompanying this EULA, which
may include computer software, associated media, printed materials,
and on-line or electronic documentation and source files, resource
files, project and solution files including source code for software,
collectively defined as "SOFTWARE".

The accompanying SOFTWARE is licensed to the LICENSEE only upon the
condition that the LICENSEE accepts all of these license terms. By
installing or using the accompanying SOFTWARE the LICENSEE agrees that
it has read these terms and agrees to be bound by them. If the
LICENSEE does not agree to all of these terms, it should not download,
install, use or copy the SOFTWARE. The SOFTWARE is protected by
copyright laws and international copyright treamties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is licensed, not
sold to the LICENSEE.


LICENSE

These Davisor License Terms cover any and all Davisor applications,
SDKs or other computer programs including related documentation
(together the "Software") licensed by the Licensee ("LICENSEE")
available for customers who choose to purchase Davisor software and
services.

The Software is licensed, not sold, to LICENSEE for use only under the
following terms. Davisor reserves any and all rights not expressly
granted to LICENSEE. Davisor retains ownership of all copies of the
Software and released updates and upgrades to the Software. For those
customers who choose to purchase Davisor software, Davisor provides
the Software only in electronic format.


SOFTWARE LICENSE GRANT

Davisor grants the use of the SOFTWARE and it's licensed components
according to one of the license types below as identified in the
Davisor License Certificate (DLC). DLC also lists LICENSEE specific
restrictions like number of CPUs, number of developers, name of the
LICENSEE application or service.

[i] Evaluation License. An Evaluation license grants a non-exclusive
right to use the SOFTWARE for evaluation use only. The SOFTWARE with
an evaluation license is fully functional except the functionality of
the SOFTWARE is limited by time. When using an evaluation license the
SOFTWARE is strictly prohibited from being used in the production of
any software or service. Any violation of this provision shall require
a mandatory purchase of an appropriate license as well as expose the
LICENSEE to other possible legal recourse for collection and punitive
damages. If the LICENSEE does not agree to the terms, it should not
evaluate this component and remove it from its computer systems
immediately.

[ii] Developer License. A Developer license grants one or more
developers to use the SOFTWARE for creating applications using the
appropriately licensed distribution version of the SOFTWARE license. A
Developer license must be purchased for each developer utilizing the
SOFTWARE. Depending on case-by-case agreed commercial terms, a
Developer license may be granted per development site (physical
location), and thus enable unlimited number of developers to work with
the SOFTWARE in that specifically defined development site.

[iii] Server License. A Server license grants the LICENSEE to install
and use the SOFTWARE for internal use only within the pre-defined
limitations written as max number of CPUs the server system running
the SOFTWARE may utilize to run the SOFTWARE. Typically, Server
license is the default production license for the SOFTWARE, and it
scales up based on the number of CPUs. In case of runtime environments
supporting server virtualization, the Server License is tied to the
specific virtualized server instance besides the number of CPUs
allocated to support that virtualized server instance.

[iv] ASP License. An ASP license grants the LICENSEE to use the
SOFTWARE to produce a named service for unlimited number of
end-users. The ASP license grants the LICENSEE to install the SOFTWARE
within the pre-defined limitations, like number of server CPUs,
written to the Davisor License Certificate. Typically an ASP License
is required if the SOFTWARE is used in an application/service running
on a server which is operating on the Internet or an Extranet made
available to the customers of the LICENSEE.

[v] OEM License. An OEM license grants the LICENSEE to create a named
licensee application utilizing the SOFTWARE. An OEM license allows the
LICENSEE to distribute the named licensee application utilizing the
SOFTWARE within the pre-defined limitations written to the Davisor
License Certificate.

All Davisor software licensees are non-transferable and non-exclusive,
and grant the LICENSEE rights to evaluate, use and/or distribute the
SOFTWARE, depending on the license type specific definitions and
limitations.

D) Decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the
Software to any human-perceivable form as the Software contains or may
contain trade secrets of Davisor and/or its partners.

LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMERS

Disclaimer of Warranty on Software. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS",
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. DAVISOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Davisor does not guarantee the Software or related
documentation in terms of their correctness, accuracy, reliability, or
otherwise. The LICENSEE assumes the entire risk as to the results and

Complete Statement of Warranty. The limited warranties provided in the
preceding paragraphs are the only warranties of any kind that are made
by Davisor on the Software. No oral or written information or advice
given by Davisor, its dealers, distributors, agents, or employees
shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the
foregoing limited warranty, and the LICENSEE may not rely on any such
information or advice. Some US states do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to those
LICENSEEs and they may have other rights which may vary from state to
state.

Indemnity. The LICENSEE agrees to hold Davisor harmless against, and
at the LICENSEE's expense handle and defend, any claim and defend any

intellectual property right. The LICENSEE shall pay all damages and
costs awarded in such suit.

INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE OR
PROFIT, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS,
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SOFTWARE OR
RELATED DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF DAVISOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  Some US states do not allow the
limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential
damages so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to the
LICENSEEs located in those US states. DAVISOR SHALL IN NO EVENT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF
THE SOFTWARE. OUR MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO THE LICENSEE FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES
FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY
THE LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE. Nothing contained in these License
Terms shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a
consumer.  Davisor is acting on behalf of its employees and licensors
or subsidiaries for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding, and/or
